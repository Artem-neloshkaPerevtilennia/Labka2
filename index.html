          Chess is a two-player strategy board game that has been played for
          centuries, originating in India as "chaturanga" before evolving into
          the modern game. It involves a 64-square board with an 8x8 grid, and
          each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two
          knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of chess is to
          checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is under direct threat
          of capture and has no legal moves to escape. Each piece has unique
          movement patterns. The queen moves in any direction, the bishop
          diagonally, the knight in an "L" shape, and pawns only forward. The
          game requires deep planning, anticipation of the opponent's moves, and
          sharp tactical thinking. It has long been a symbol of intellectual
          prowess and has grown into a global competitive sport, with
          international tournaments and world championships drawing millions of
          fans. Chess also has a rich history of famous games, iconic players
          like Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov, and a variety of openings and
          strategies that players can employ. It has become more accessible than
          ever with online platforms, allowing people to play or learn the game
          anytime, anywhere.
